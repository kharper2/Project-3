      <h4>Denial</h4>
      <p>When I was four, my mother read that immersing children in music was beneficial with learning math in school.</p>
      <p>As a result, I was forced into playing the piano.</p>
      <p>I couldn&#038;t believe it&#33; How could my own mother tourture me so?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My teacher was mean.</li>
        <li>I didn&#038;t like the songs I was assigned to practice.</li>
        <li>I never understood what was so beautiful about pressing keys&#821;1&#8211;it felt impersonal. Or as my child self would say, boring.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It was the worst time of my life</p>
    </section>
    <section id="anger">
      <h4>Anger</h4>
      <p>I had had enough. I grew to resent playing the piano and I quit.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="bargaining">
      <h4>Bargaining</h4>
      <p>My mother told me I needed to pick up another instrument.</p>
      <p>I simply didn&#038;t see the value in doing so.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="depression">
      <h4>Depression</h4>
      <p>I was overwhelmed. I felt helpless.</p>
      <p>No other instrument appealed to me, but my mother would not give up.<p>
    </section>
    <section id="acceptance">
      <h4>Acceptance</h4>
      <p>Then, like a sign from the heavens, I saw my saving grace: That which posses two mustaches and the tail of a croissant.</p>
      <p>I was in church when I saw people playing the violin and knew that that was the instrument I wanted to play.</p>
      <p>Out of my own will, I have stuck with it ever since. Below is a piece I am currently working on&#33;</p>
